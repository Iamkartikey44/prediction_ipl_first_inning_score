The IPL First Inning Score Prediction project is about predicting score of batting first team.

This web application have IPL 2021 teams where you can predict their score of batting first
## Deployment

To run a Flask deployment tests,run the following command

```bash
  python app.py
```
### Steps to Deploy The App:

## Future Scope

1. Add columns in dataset of top batsman and bowlers of all the teams currently playing.
2. Add columns that consists  of striker and non-striker's strike-rate.
3. Implement this problem using Deep Learning for future improvement
